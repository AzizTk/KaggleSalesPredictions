# KaggleSalesPredictions
Another submission to Kaggle to a Russian software firm's sale's predicitions
I tried pushing this as soon as i finish a project but i came back to github a little late so i'm showing off my work the way i did it 2 months prior to this. THis was an old project and i got to 84% prediction rating which is about top 5% in the leaderboard (759 by the time I'm writing this).
2 months of work, and We were 3 students and 1 Machine Learning professor working on this, Had so much fun and learnt soo much.
Hope you like it :D
